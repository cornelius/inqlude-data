  "description": "When a user is interacting with a computer, there are three main areas of\ncontextual information that may affect the behaviour of the system: who the user\nis, where they are, and what they are doing.\n\n*Activities* deal with the last one. An activity might be \"developing a KDE\napplication\", \"studying 19th century art\", \"composing music\" or \"watching funny\nvideos\". Each of these activites may involve multiple applications, and a single\napplication may be used in multiple activities (for example, most activities are\nlikely to involve using a web browser, but different activities will probably\ninvolve different websites).\n\nKActivities provides the infrastructure needed to manage a user's activites,\nallowing them to switch between tasks, and for applications to update their\nstate to match the user's current activity. This includes a daemon, a library\nfor interacting with that daemon, and plugins for integration with other\nframeworks.",
