  "description": "\nKWayland provides two libraries:\n\n- KWayland::Client\n- KWayland::Server\n\nAs the names suggest they implement a Client respectively a Server API for the Wayland protocol. The API is Qt-styled removing the needs to interact with a for a Qt developer uncomfortable low-level C-API. For example the callback mechanism from the Wayland API is replaced by signals; data types are adjusted to be what a Qt developer expects, e.g. two arguments of int are represented by a QPoint or a QSize.\n\n",
