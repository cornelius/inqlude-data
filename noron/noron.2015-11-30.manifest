  "description": "This tool implements remote object sharing (Object Oriented RPC) in Qt. From a technical point of view it can compare with Java RMI or similar technologies. Noron has an advanced signaling mechanism. A property change on a peer (server or client) will immediately signal a change on other peers. It can transfer every QVariant type (even QPixmap and complex types). For more details see RpcChat sample. More information can be found in the Wiki.",
