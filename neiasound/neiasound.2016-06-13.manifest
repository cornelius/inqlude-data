  "description": "\nneiasound is a Qt-style OpenAL wrapper for games. Not yet complete but already very useful. It is a clean, convenient api that can be plugged directly into your main loop. It comes with a (very primitive) .wav file reader, and includes stb_vorbis directly in the source tree. Also supports libsndfile.\n\nThere is also support for streaming dynamic playlists with intros and seamless looping.\n\n",
