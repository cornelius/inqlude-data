  "description": "The KActivitiesStats library provides a querying mechanism for the data\nthat the activitiy manager collects - which documents hae been opened by\nwhich applications, and what documents have been linked to which activity.\nThe activity manager also keeps the score for each document which gets\nhigher when a particular document has been often accessed or kept open\nfor longer periods of time. This score is also available through the\nquerying mechanism.",
