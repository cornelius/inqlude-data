  "description": "This framework implements almost all the file management functions you\nwill ever need. In fact, the KDE file manager (Dolphin) and the KDE\nfile dialog also uses this to provide its network-enabled file management.\n\nIt supports accessing files locally as well as via HTTP and FTP out of the\nbox and can be extended by plugins to support other protocols as well. There\nis a variety of plugins available, e.g. to support access via SSH.\n\nThe framework can also be used to bridge a native protocol to a file-based\ninterface. This makes the data accessible in all applications using the KDE\nfile dialog or any other KIO enabled infrastructure.",
