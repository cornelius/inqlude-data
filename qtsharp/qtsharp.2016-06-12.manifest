  "description": "QtSharp is a project which aims to create Mono/.NET libraries that wrap Qt thus enabling its usage through C#. It relies on the excellent CppSharp. It is a generator that expects the include and library directories of a Qt set-up and then generates and compiles the wrappers. There is no Qt included in the repository, users have to download and install Qt themselves. The source code is separated into a library that contains the settings and passes the generator needs, and a command-line client.",
